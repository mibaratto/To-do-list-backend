# To-do-list

## About 
The project is a back-end application made during the Labenu bootcamp. It's an exercise to review concepts like Git, NodeJS, Typescript, Express, SQL/SQLite, Knex and Postman. The main objective was to create a task manager that allowed registering members and tasks of a team.
